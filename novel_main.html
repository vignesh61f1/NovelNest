 Jane Eyre
 </td>

 <td class="detail" rowspan="1" width="50%" align='center'>
 Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, another novel often assigned for reading in school, was initially
published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currer Bell to disguise the fact that the writer was a woman.
Fortunately, a lot has changed with regard to women in literature since 1847, and Brontë now receives the
credit she deserves for one of the most-groundbreaking novels about women in history. At a time when the
author felt compelled to hide her true identity, Jane Eyre provided a story of individualism for women. The
novel’s eponymous character rises from being orphaned and poor into a successful and independent woman.
The work combines themes from both Gothic and Victorian literature, revolutionizing the art of the novel by
focusing on the growth in Jane’s sensibility with internalized action and writing.

 Anna Karenina
 </td>

 <tr>
 <td class="detail" rowspan="1" width="50%" align='center'>
 Any fan of stories that involve juicy subjects like adultery, gambling, marriage plots, and, well,
Russian feudalism, would instantly place Anna Karenina at the peak of their “greatest novels” list. And
that’s exactly the ranking that publications like Time magazine have given the novel since it was published
in its entirety in 1878. Written by Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, the eight-part towering work of fiction tells 
the story of two major characters: a tragic, disenchanted housewife, the titular Anna, who runs off with her
young lover, and a lovestruck landowner named Konstantin Levin, who struggles in faith and philosophy.
Tolstoy molds together thoughtful discussions on love, pain, and family in Russian society with a sizable
cast of characters regarded for their realistic humanity. The novel was especially revolutionary in its
treatment of women, depicting prejudices and social hardships of the time with vivid emotion.

 One Hundred Years of Solitude

 The late Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez published his most-famous work, One Hundred
Years of Solitude, in 1967. The novel tells the story of seven generations of the Buendía family and follows
the establishment of their town Macondo until its destruction along with the last of the family’s descendents.
In fantastical form, the novel explores the genre of magic realism by emphasizing the extraordinary nature
of commonplace things while mystical things are shown to be common. Márquez highlights the prevalence
and power of myth and folktale in relating history and Latin American culture. The novel won many awards
for Márquez, leading the way to his eventual honor of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982 for his entire
body of work, of which One Hundred Years of Solitude is often lauded as his most triumphant.

 Invisible Man

 <tr>
    <td class="detail" rowspan="1" width="50%" align='center'>
    Often confused with H.G. Wells’s science-fiction novella of nearly the same name (just subtract a
   “The”), Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man is a groundbreaking novel in the expression of identity for the African
   American male. The narrator of the novel, a man who is never named but believes he is “invisible” to others
   socially, tells the story of his move from the South to college and then to New York City. In each location he
   faces extreme adversity and discrimination, falling into and out of work, relationships, and questionable
   social movements in a wayward and ethereal mindset. The novel is renowned for its surreal and
   experimental style of writing that explores the symbolism surrounding African American identity and
   culture. Invisible Man won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1953.

    Don Quixote

    <td class="detail" rowspan="1" width="50%" align='center'>
    Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote, perhaps the most influential and well-known work of Spanish
   literature, was first published in full in 1615. The novel, which is very regularly regarded as one of the best
   literary works of all time, tells the story of a man who takes the name “Don Quixote de la Mancha” and sets
   off in a fit of obsession over romantic novels about chivalry to revive the custom and become a hero himself.
   The character of Don Quixote has become an idol and somewhat of an archetypal character, influencing
   many major works of art, music, and literature since the novel’s publication. The text has been so influential
   that a word, quixotic, based on the Don Quixote character, was created to describe someone who is,
   “foolishly impractical especially in the pursuit of ideals; especially: marked by rash lofty romantic ideas or
   extravagantly chivalrous action.”

 A Passage to India
 </td> </tr> <tr>
 <td class="detail" rowspan="1" width="50%" align='center'>
 E.M. Forster wrote his novel A Passage to India after multiple trips to the country throughout his early
life. The book was published in 1924 and follows a Muslim Indian doctor named Aziz and his relationships
with an English professor, Cyril Fielding, and a visiting English schoolteacher named Adela Quested. When
Adela believes that Aziz has assaulted her while on a trip to the Marabar caves near the fictional city of
Chandrapore, where the story is set, tensions between the Indian community and the colonial British
community rise. The possibility of friendship and connection between English and Indian people, despite
their cultural differences and imperial tensions, is explored in the conflict. The novel’s colorful descriptions
of nature, the landscape of India, and the figurative power that they are given within the text solidifies it as a
great work of fiction.
